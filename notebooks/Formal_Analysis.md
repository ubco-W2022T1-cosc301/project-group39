# Milestone 3, Task 4
## This is our formal analysis to answer our questions proposed in milestone 2.

### <b>What is considered a mass shooting?</b>

The question I would most like to answer through an analysis of our data is what is required for it to be considered a mass shooting. Without a proper definition it is difficult to tell, but it is generally accepted that a mass shooting has a minimum of three or four victims. When looking through our data of total injured or killed in each incident, we can tell that on average 4.97 people were either injured or killed in each shooting that occured. This means that a majority of the shootings that occured in the U.S over the past 7 years can be considered mass shootings. Something to note as well, this was the average even after I filtered out extreme incidents of more than 15 killed or 20 injured, so if we were analyzing the full dataset, the average would be even higher.
#####  <br/>
### <b> Has the number of shootings been increasing?</b>
After analyzing our data by month and year, I can confidently say the frequency of shootings has steadily risen over the past seven years. 2020 alone had over 600 seperate shooting incidents which is more than double the amount of shootings that occured in 2014. 
### <b> The graph below shows the number of shootings from 2014-2020</b>

### <b> How often do shootings occur in the U.S.</b>
Over our 7 years of data analyzed an average of 1.05 shootings occured each day. This quite a concerning metric as other similarly developed countries such as Canada, Australia or the U.K.have no where near the amount or frequency of shootings as the U.S does.
### <b> Gun related Killings as a percent of homecides </b>

As you can in the above table, gun violence has a disproportionately higher percent only in the U.S.
