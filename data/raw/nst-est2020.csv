"Notes: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and were created without incorporation or consideration of the 2020 Census results. The estimates add births to, subtract deaths from, and add net migration to the enumerated resident population from the 2010 Census. The enumerated resident population is the total population (citizen and noncitizen) with usual residence in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. See https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term_Apportionmentpopulation and https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term_Residentpopulation. The estimates reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See Geographic Terms and Definitions at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/guidance-geographies/terms-and-definitions.html for a list of the states that are included in each region. All geographic boundaries for the 2020 population estimates series are as of January 1, 2020. For population estimates methodology statements, see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
