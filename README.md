Overall, the main interest that we have as a group is why this issue with gun violence is so prevalent within the United States. It is something that, as a group, we are somewhat apalled by when it comes to lack of action from the proper authorites. However, one of the things that we also realize is that the media sometimes can take things out of proportion and not report the most accurate informaton. With that being said, one of the things we would like to do with this analytics project is to find and learn about accurate information and to gain a better idea as the severity of gun violence in the United States. Probably the main question that we are looking to explore has to do with the locations of incidents regarding gun violence. These could include things such as what states/cities have the highest levels of gun violence. Overall, we think that we should be able to create a user facing Dashboard using this dataset in the final weeks of this course.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our dataset is a dataset that includes information regarding incidents of mass shootings and gun violence that have taken place in the United States, with the first piece of data being collected on January 1, 2014 and the last piece being collected on May 26, 2021. Our data includes information about these incidents such as the date, the location (state, city, address), as well as the number of victims in the incident. This dataset was created by an individual named Gnjijalanka Rhapsody (we are unsure where they got this information from). From the information available to us, it looks like this information was collected in order for Rhapsody to make their own project based on the levels of gun violence within the United States, however we cannot confirm this. As far as we can tell from the dataset, it appears that the data was collected by a human. However this is something we cannot confirm. Overall, this dataset does have some holes in it as the data itself is a bit limiting in terms of what we can research. However, we should still be able to ddo meaningful reasearch with what we have.
